# README

Everything in here is free for your use.

I have no plans on updating this project in the near future

Known Kinks:
  Guns consist of multiple materials, unoptimized for shack as it increases draw calls
  Shotgun (m45) currently only works online, and in the left hand
  Unorganized content browser. I didn't revise over this project for a "proper halo weapons release" so there may be some extra stuff including things for other projects and other guns which you may use.
